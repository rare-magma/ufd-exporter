## Relevant documentation

- [UFD](https://www.ufd.es/)
- [InfluxDB API](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.6/write-data/developer-tools/api/)
- [Systemd Timers](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.timer.html)

## Installation

### With the Makefile

For convenience, you can install this exporter with the following command or follow the manual process described in the next paragraph.

```
make install
$EDITOR $HOME/.config/ufd_exporter.conf
```

### Manually

1. Copy `ufd_exporter.sh` to `$HOME/.local/bin/` and make it executable.

2. Copy `ufd_exporter.conf` to `$HOME/.config/`, configure it (see the configuration section below) and make it read only.

3. Copy the systemd unit and timer to `$HOME/.config/systemd/user/`:

```
cp ufd-exporter.* $HOME/.config/systemd/user/
```

5. and run the following command to activate the timer:

```
systemctl --user enable --now ufd-exporter.timer
```

It's possible to trigger the execution by running manually:

```
systemctl --user start ufd-exporter.service
```

### Config file

The config file has a few options:

```
INFLUXDB_HOST='influxdb.example.com'
INFLUXDB_API_TOKEN='ZXhhbXBsZXRva2VuZXhhcXdzZGFzZGptcW9kcXdvZGptcXdvZHF3b2RqbXF3ZHFhc2RhCg=='
ORG='home'
BUCKET='ufd'
UFD_USERNAME='username'
UFD_PASSWORD='password'
CUPS='ES0000000000000000XX0X'
```

- `INFLUXDB_HOST` should be the FQDN of the influxdb server.
- `ORG` should be the name of the influxdb organization that contains the energy consumption data bucket defined below.
- `BUCKET` should be the name of the influxdb bucket that will hold the energy consumption data.
- `INFLUXDB_API_TOKEN` should be the influxdb API token value.
  - This token should have write access to the `BUCKET` defined above.
- `UFD_USERNAME` and `UFD_PASSWORD`should be the credentials used to access the UFD website
- `CUPS` should be the CÃ³digo Unificado de Punto de Suministro (CUPS)

## Troubleshooting

Run the script manually with bash set to trace:

```
bash -x $HOME/.local/bin/ufd_exporter.sh
```

Check the systemd service logs and timer info with:

```
journalctl --user --unit ufd-exporter.service
systemctl --user list-timers
```

## Exported metrics

The UFD API call period is limited to the last 30 days by default.

- pX: The energy consumption in kWh for the corresponding period type
- cups: The cups corresponding to the consumption point above

## Exported metrics example

```
ufd_consumption,cups=ES0000000000000000XX0X p1=0.123,p2=0,p3=0,p4=0,p5=0,p6=0 1672610400
```

## Example grafana dashboard

In `ufd-dashboard.json` there is an example of the kind of dashboard that can be built with `ufd-exporter` data:

<img src="dashboard-screenshot.png" title="Example grafana dashboard" width="100%">

Import it by doing the following:

1. Create a dashboard
2. Click the dashboard's settings button on the top right.
3. Go to JSON Model and then paste there the content of the `ufd-dashboard.json` file.

## Uninstallation

### With the Makefile

For convenience, you can uninstall this exporter with the following command or follow the process described in the next paragraph.

```
make uninstall
```

### Manually

Run the following command to deactivate the timer:

```
systemctl --user disable --now ufd-exporter.timer
```

Delete the following files:

```
~/.local/bin/ufd_exporter.sh
~/.config/ufd_exporter.conf
~/.config/systemd/user/ufd-exporter.timer
~/.config/systemd/user/ufd-exporter.service
```
